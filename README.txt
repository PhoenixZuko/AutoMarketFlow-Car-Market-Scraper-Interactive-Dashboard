🚨 IMPORTANT: PLEASE READ BEFORE RUNNING 🚨


1.

Before you run START_CLICK_HERE.bat,
you MUST have the following installed on your computer:



1️⃣ Google Chrome – required for automation  
👉 Download: https://www.google.com/chrome/  
✅ If Chrome is already installed, you don’t need to reinstall it.
 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.

2️⃣ Python (version 3.x) – required to run the scripts  

📁 Inside the folder `AutoMarket_Installer_Pack`, you will find the Python installer:  
👉 `python-3.13.5-amd64.exe`

💡 Right-click on it and select:  
➡️ **Run as administrator**

❗ During installation, make sure to CHECK the box:  
✅ **"Add Python to PATH"**  
This is VERY important — the script will not work without it.

---------------------------------------------------------

3.

✅ Once both Chrome and Python are installed, double-click:  
👉 `START_CLICK_HERE.bat`

It will:
- Install all dependencies automatically
- Set up everything
- Launch the dashboard and automation tools in your browser


⚠️ IMPORTANT FIRST-TIME STEP:

After the dashboard appears in your browser,  
you can safely close **both the browser and the command window**.

✅ At this point, the program is fully installed.

However, for first-time use, you still need to log into Facebook manually.  
To do that, run:
👉 `first_time_facebook_login.bat`

This will open Facebook using the same Chrome profile used by the program.

🔓 Just log in once — the session will be saved automatically.  
From now on, every time you run `START_CLICK_HERE.bat`,  
you will stay logged in and the automation will work without asking again.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

💾 After logging in, your session will be saved automatically in the Chrome profile.  
This means you will **not need to log in again** in the future.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


✅ After this, you can use `START_CLICK_HERE.bat` normally anytime —  
your session will remain active, and everything will work automatically.
