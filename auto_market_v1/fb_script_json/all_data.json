During that time I've rebuilt the front suspension, changed trans fluid, replaced brakes, added Jegs ignition coils, and replaced the cooling fan. Runs great. No lights except air suspension which has been replaced with coils. New tires on 18\" Ford explorer wheels. They are custom machined to fit the Lincoln hubs. It's in good shape for a 19 year old car. It has custom exhaust with gutted cats, but passes inspection due to no codes. It's been the most reliable car I've ever owned. Hate to see it go but I bought SUVs that fit my family better. $4700 See less",

Bought tires right before it started having problems and it’s been parked on non-op since then besides the occasional spin around the block. Some times it doesn’t even misfire and drives fine. Heated leather seats, AC works great, paddle shifters, Bluetooth, passed smog a year ago. Come check it out. Wanted to fix one day, but just broke up with my girl and need to down size my life.

I bought it several years ago as a spare drift car to my other e30 but then got out of drifting. It’s been sitting for 5 years but has new oil, water pump, radiator, coolant hoses and a few other parts, it’s in running and driving shape. I have several extra wheels and tires for it that will come with. I also have spare g260 transmissions if interested. With a turbo, it would be very competitive, but as is with some small things like seats, it would be a great drift car. $10k obo, I can deliver within reason. Possibly trade for dump trailer and some cash. See less",

I bought another car while this car was being worked on. I loved driving the car. Its sporty with a manual transmission. Its been parked now a year, Since the day I picked it up from Engine Masters. I need 2 cars like I need 2 bellybuttons. On the drive from the shop, I noticed a sunvisor bracket now broken while at the shop, and as I was leaving Engine Masters, the person who retrieved my car told me they were having trouble removing the key from the Ignition. That was never an issue prior, so, idk. Now that I have another car, Im not going to put any more $ into repairs or insurance. Selling as is and hope it finds a good home.

With a newly rebuilt engine (2022) from Bob Speed in Florida, it has been a daily driver for over 15 years and therefore the car has been meticulously maintained throughout including new rear bearings, full brakes (calipers, pads, rotors), suspension springs, body mounts, aftermarket gauges, starter, carb rebuild, and battery all within the last few years. The Berlinetta trim runs on a 305 V8 mated to a 3-speed automatic transmission, and runs, drives, shifts, and stops incredibly strong. The vehicle only has 14,900 miles put on since the rebuilt engine was installed.Needless to say, this beauty is a real head-turner with new paint from 2022. The exterior is in excellent condition with no rust, rot, or corrosion anywhere on or under the car. With power steering and brakes, and an ice-cold Air Conditioner, this Camaro is the perfect choice for someone who wants to DRIVE. The Berlinetta is located in Southwest Beaches, Florida, with a clean FL title and a new improved price of $10,500. Message me with any questions, or more information. See less",
